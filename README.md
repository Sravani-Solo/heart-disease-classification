## Overview
This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for an end-to-end heart disease classification project. The project's primary goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on a set of medical features and data.

## Project Structure
- **Data**: This directory contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- **Code**: Python scripts and modules for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- **Models**: Saved machine learning models.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics, charts, and reports generated during the model evaluation.
- **Documentation**: Project documentation, research papers, and articles.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the step-by-step instructions in the Jupyter notebooks located in the `end-to-end-heart-disease-classification/` directory. These notebooks cover data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.

## Dependencies
The project relies on various Python libraries and packages, including but not limited to:
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- seaborn

## Data
The dataset used in this project is available in the data/ directory. Ensure that you have downloaded and preprocessed the data before running the notebooks or scripts.

## Model Deployment
If you intend to deploy the trained model for production use, refer to the deployment section in the documentation for guidelines and best practices.

## Contributions
