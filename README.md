## End-to-End Heart Disease Classification
### Overview
This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for an end-to-end heart disease classification project. The project's primary goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on a set of medical features and data.

### Project Structure
**1. Data:** This directory contains the dataset used for training and evaluation. The dataset includes a variety of medical features and a target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

**2. Notebooks:** This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that walk through the various stages of the project, including data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation. These notebooks provide detailed explanations of the steps taken in the project.

**3. Code:** This directory contains Python scripts and modules used for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. The code is organized into different modules for clarity and reusability.

**4. Models:** After training, the best-performing models are saved in this directory for later use or deployment.

**5. Evaluation:** This directory contains evaluation metrics, charts, and reports generated during the model evaluation process. It provides insights into the model's performance.

**6. Documentation:** Documentation related to the project, including project notes, research papers, and any relevant articles.
